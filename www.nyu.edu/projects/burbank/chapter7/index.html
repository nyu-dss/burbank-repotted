<h3 style="text-align:center;">Legal Recourse in a Time of Troubles</h3>

<div class="img"><img src="new-mother-daughter-sepia.gif"  /></a>

<br/>
How did war and revolution affect the township courts and rural litigants?  My surveys of court cases permit comparisons with pre-war times, and allow us both to look at the impact of war and revolution on rural communities and to consider the ways that a legal forum was used by people in undeniably difficult and disruptive times.   The data presented on the site display variations in cases heard in pre-war, wartime, and, in some cases, 1917.  Among the topics examined comparatively are appeals, the sex of parties and witnesses, subjects and outcomes of cases with relation to the sexes of the parties, the role of policemen, types of criminal cases, family relations of contesting parties, sentences, amounts of fines and payments, length of arrests, reconciliations, and family relationships of contesting parties. In addition, the site expands upon content, outcomes, family relationships of cases in particular areas in 1916 and 1917.<br/>
